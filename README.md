# Kulfi & Malai

Open Source, General Purpose, Sovereign, Decentralized, Peer to Peer Internet.

---

## Malai

Malai is a simple tool that can be used to expose any local service (HTTP, TCP and, SSH etc.) to the
world. It can be paired up with an ACL system (like Kulfi) to control access to the exposed
services.

## Kulfi

Kulfi is a peer to peer network, free from any corporate control. Data stays with the user, and
devices controlled by the user, and not with some central company.

Kulfi will soon be available as an binary that you can download and run on your computer. We will
support Linux, Windows and MacOS from day one. We also want to create Apps that can be distributed
through App Stores, and also support mobile devices.

To learn more about how Kulfi works, see Journeys [here](https://kulfi.app/doc/journeys/).

`kulfi` and `malai` are built on top of [iroh][iroh], and uses [BitTorrent's Mainline
DHT][MainlineDHT] for peer discovery.
