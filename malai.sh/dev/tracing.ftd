-- ds.heading-large: Tracing In Malai

We have built in tracing support, which can output more information to help
debug issues. You can enabled it by setting RUST_LOG environment variable to
`trace` before running the command. But this is too verbose, so we usually
set it to `malai=trace,kulfi_util=trace` to only get the tracing information
from the `malai` and `kulfi-util` crates.

-- ds.code: Enable Tracing
lang: sh

RUST_LOG="malai=trace,kulfi_utils=trace" cargo run --bin malai -- tcp-bridge

-- ds.copy-regular:

Feel free to add more tracing information to the codebase. We are happy to
accept them, keep things logged and easy to debug.
